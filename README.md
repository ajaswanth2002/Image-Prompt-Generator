# Image Prompt Generator

Image Prompt Generator is a project aimed at extracting text from images, modifying the text using prompting techniques, and converting the modified text back into images. This project utilizes various modules and libraries to achieve its functionality.

## üìù Project Description

The core functionality of the Image Prompt Generator revolves around processing images to extract text, applying prompts to modify the text, and then converting the modified text back into images. This process can be useful in various applications such as image captioning, text-based image editing, and more.

## üõ†Ô∏è Modules

### 1. Gradio
![Gradio](https://img.shields.io/badge/Gradio-2.0.0-blue)

Gradio is a Python library that provides a simple interface for creating UI components for machine learning models. In this project, Gradio is utilized to create an intuitive interface for users to interact with the image prompt generation process.

### 2. Torch

StableDiffusionPipeline is a library that provides tools for stable image generation using diffusion models. It helps in generating high-quality images from textual prompts.

## üîÑ Process

### Step 1: Image Caption Generator

The first step involves using the Gradio model for image caption generation. Users are required to upload an image through the interface and press the "Caption" button. The model then generates a descriptive text regarding the content of the uploaded image.

### Step 2: Prompt Generation

In the second step, the generated image caption is used to create prompts. Certain random keywords related to the product are incorporated into the text to enhance its specificity. This step results in the final modified text ready for further processing.

### Step 3: Image Plotting

The final step utilizes the StableDiffusionPipeline module to plot images based on the prompts generated in the previous step. Since the project is executed in a Colab environment, it provides the convenience of viewing all generated images in a single plot. Each row in the plot displays five images for the specific product, totaling 25 images in one plot. This visualization aids in quickly assessing the variations and outcomes of the prompt generation process.

## üöÄ Usage

To use the Image Prompt Generator, follow these steps:

1. Install the required dependencies mentioned in the `requirements.txt` file.
2. Run the main script of the project, which typically involves providing an image as input.
3. The project will extract text from the input image and present it to the user.
4. The user can then provide prompts to modify the extracted text.
5. The modified text is converted back into an image using the specified model and displayed to the user.
